### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
  <div id="before"></div>
  <div id="after"></div>
   <div id="notch"></div>
```
```css
#notch, #before, #after {
  content: "";
}
```

To be very honest, I didn't think something like that could work. I was in a tight spot with that particular design until I googled it.


### Continued development

A lot of things to learn... I don't know where to start. Sorry I'm being vague but... It is what it is. Also, I just found out about the keyframes for the animations... 
It was really new to me and a bit overwhelming but I think I got it.
